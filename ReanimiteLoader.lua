	Instructions:
	Place this script at the bottom of the 
	script you are wanting to replicate, 
	and submit relevant entrie(s) 
	to the ReplicationTable.
	
	Note:
	See "Submitting ReplicationTable Entrie(s)"
	to know how to add entrie(s).

	ReanimationDummy Configuration:
	
	If you are using a script that uses
	a custom rig, e.g. Touch√©'s Horse script.
	
	You would want to define the ReanimationDummy
	variable as that scripts rig, e.g.
	ReanimationDummy = Character
	
	Or just use the scripts Character variable in
	the ReplicationTable.

--[[
	Submitting ReplicationTable Entrie(s):
	
	The ReplicationTable is passed to the
	ReanimationModule's Reanimate function
	when reanimating.
	
	It is expected to contain entrie(s) on
	what you want to replicate with your hats.

	Example:
	
	{
		Part0 = "ScifiMovieHat",
		Part1 = ReanimationRig["Left Arm"],
		Transform = CFrame.Angles(math.rad(90),0,0)
	}
	
	Part0 can be the accessory's name (string) (See this easily with Dex explorer), the accessory's Handle (BasePart), or the accessory's AssetId (number)* e.g. "RedHat", Character.RedHat.Handle, 80930922586072
	Part1 is the BasePart you are replicating your accessory to
	Transform is the CFrame offset from Part1
	
	Template:
	{Part0 = , Part1 = BasePart, Transform = CFrame.new(0,0,0) * CFrame.Angles(math.rad(0), math.rad(0), math.rad(0))}

	*Please note that if you use AssetId for Part0, expect a lag spike on first load of that AssetId. AssetId may not be for you if you do not have a stable internet connection, please let-
	-me know if you experience issues with anything at all, especially this.
